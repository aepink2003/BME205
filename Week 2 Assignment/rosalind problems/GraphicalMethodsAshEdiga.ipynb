It determines the number of k-mers based on the length of the text. After extracting all k-mers, it sorts them in lexicographical order. The provided sample data demonstrates the function's usage, where it extracts 5-mers from the text '' and prints them.\n","\n","# Problem 9\n","This code defines a function, string_spelled_by_genome_path, which reconstructs a genome sequence from a list of overlapping k-mers. The function starts with the first k-mer and then appends the last symbol of each subsequent k-mer to build the genome. The provided sample usage reads k-mers from the file 'rosalind_ba3b-2.txt' and then uses the function to reconstruct and print the genome sequence.\n","\n","# Problem 10\n","overlap_graph: This function constructs an overlap graph for a set of k-mers. In this graph, there exists a directed edge from one k-mer to another if the suffix (excluding the first character) of the first k-mer matches the prefix (excluding the last character) of the second k-mer.\n","\n","print_adjacency_list: This function prints out the adjacency list representation of the overlap graph.\n","\n","the code is designed to determine how given k-mers can overlap with each other, forming an overlap graph, and then display this graph in a readable format.\n","\n","# Problem 11\n","de_bruijn_graph(k, text): This function constructs a De Bruijn graph from a given text and a k-mer length \n","k\n","k. The function returns a dictionary where keys represent k-1 length prefixes and values are lists of k-1 length suffixes of the overlapping k-mers.\n","\n","format_output(edges): This function formats the De Bruijn graph into a readable string representation, where each key (prefix) is followed by its corresponding values (suffixes).\n","\n","input(filename): This function reads the input from a file. The file is expected to contain two lines: the first line is the integer \n","k\n","k (k-mer length) and the second line is the text from which the graph is constructed.\n","\n","# Problem 12\n","This provided code defines a function, de_bruijn_graph(patterns), which constructs a De Bruijn graph from a collection of k-mers (patterns). The function works by iterating over each k-mer, extracting its prefix and suffix, and then building an adjacency list representation of the graph.\n","\n","# Problem 13\n","parse_graph_data(data): This function processes the raw string data (representing the graph) and parses it into a dictionary format. This dictionary (graph) uses nodes as keys and their corresponding neighbors as values (in a list format).\n","find_eulerian_path(graph): This function identifies an Eulerian path in the given graph using Hierholzer's algorithm. The function starts by calculating the in-degrees and out-degrees for all nodes. It then determines the starting node for the Eulerian path based on the degrees. Using Hierholzer's algorithm, it iteratively traverses the graph, building the path by moving through edges and removing them once visited.\n","The sample data provided in the variable data represents a graph in the form of an adjacency list. This data is parsed using parse_graph_data(data) to create the graph dictionary.\n","Finally, the code calls find_eulerian_path(graph) on the parsed graph and prints the Eulerian path.\n","\n","# Problem 14\n","de_bruijn_graph(k, patterns): This function constructs a De Bruijn graph from a collection of k-mers. The graph is represented as an adjacency list using a dictionary.\n","eulerian_path(graph): This function determines an Eulerian path in the De Bruijn graph. It includes two sub-functions:\n","find_starting_node(graph): Identifies the starting and ending nodes for the Eulerian path based on the in-degrees and out-degrees of the nodes.\n","find_eulerian_path(node, graph): Constructs the Eulerian path by traversing through the graph from the starting node.\n","reconstruct_string_from_kmers(k, patterns): This function uses the De Bruijn graph to reconstruct the genome string from the provided k-mers. It creates the graph using the de_bruijn_graph() function, determines the Eulerian path with eulerian_path(), and then assembles the genome string from the path.\n","The code then reads k-mers from the file 'rosalind_ba3h-4.txt', reconstructs the genome string using these k-mers, and prints the result.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XOOWdf2yUi6e"},"source":["# Problem
